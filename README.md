# World of Daggerfall Project

This project fills Daggerfall's vast wilderness with thousands upon thousands of rocks, mountains, bandit camps, forts, towers, ruins, and shrines. These new locations make traveling on highways more interesting and traveling on back roads more perilous. All provinces are included in the initial release. Moreover, World of Daggerfall is a continuing project in the vein of Morrowind's Tamriel Rebuilt. We aim to continually add more content, create new experiences and original locations for players to enjoy, and to make the Iliac Bay come to life. We will also release and maintain tools that allow any modder to add their own locations to the game.

## Mods
World of Daggerfall consists of two mods:
- **Location Loader**, by KABoissonneault and UncannyValley, with major contributions by Kamer: a mod for loading new "locations" into the game.
- **World of Daggerfall**, by Kamer, carademono, and KABoissonneault : a mod containing the prefabs and location files that add nearly 200,000 new locations to the game.

## Tools
- **Prefab Editor**, by UncannyValley and KABoissonneault: an easy-to-use tool in Unity Editor for building individual locations.
- **GIS Construction Kit**, by carademono: a project for QGIS that allows for the individual or mass placement of locations in the Daggerfall game world.
